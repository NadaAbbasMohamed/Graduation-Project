# Camera-Calibration---fisheye-effect-removal
Camera calibration is a technique used in multiple applications. in this project I used it to calculate the camera matrix (rotational and transitional parameters of the camera) to generate linear view of the monitored are and then enable us from performing further operations on the captured image.  
The repository is made up of 2 files:
The 1st is for generating the camera matrix and applying the unistorting operation on a single image
The 2nd is for capturing images in a successive sequence as multiple number of chess-board images are required to calculate the camera matrix 

is added a sample image showing the fisheye effect on the captured image and the chess board pattern used 8x8
